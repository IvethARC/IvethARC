# Hey! I'm Iveth

I'm a mathematician by profession with a great taste for programming. I like the development of interfaces, the logic of algorithms and what programming itself can achieve. Constantly learning.


## ðŸš€ About Me
Angular is my favorite framework but I have knowledge of React and I am training for fullstack with Java. More than 3 years in the development world and I hope it can be many more.
